          <p>I am an independent photographer based in Ballina, County Mayo. All photos on this website were taken in the past year using a Sony A6000, mounted with a Sony 18-50mm lens. Locations of these photos vary between Sligo and Ballina, but the vast majority were taken on the banks of the river Moy, in Ballina.</p>
          <p>We are able to print any images you send to us. As an example, view the images on the left for an example of our work. Our products are available at a wide range of prices depending on the size and material of the print.</p>
          <p>Average delivery times are dependent on the requested items and the location of the recipient. All deliveries are only within the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. If the recipient is in Northern Ireland, then additional delivery charges will be charged due to Brexit.</p>
          <p>All of the photos on this website are subject to copyright and are under a Creative Commons License prohibiting their use in other webpages without prior consent as provided by the website owner.</p>
